        comment: "The 'Call Centre Agents' field is correctly implemented in the waitlist form. The field label shows 'Call Centre Agents *', the dropdown placeholder text is 'Select number of call centre agents', and all required options (0-15, 16-25, 26-50, 51-100, 101-200, 200+) are present. Backend integration with Supabase is working correctly - all test submissions with different call centre agent values were successful with 201 status codes. The field data is correctly stored in the student_count column in Supabase."
